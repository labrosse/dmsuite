dmsuite
=======

A collection of spectral collocation differentiation matrices

This collection is based on their original matlab/octave version developed by
Weidemann and Reddy and available from `DMSUITE`__. The theory and examples are
explained in their paper: J. A. C. Weidemann and S. C. Reddy, A MATLAB
Differentiation Matrix Suite, ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 26,
(2000): 465-519.

The port to python was initiated as part of a larger project by
ronojoy as https://github.com/ronojoy/pyddx.git

It is `available on PyPI`__. You can install
and update dmsuite with the following command::

    python3 -m pip install --user -U dmsuite
